## Portfolio

This portfolio exists to document my progress as a backend systems engineer.

Instead of focusing on frameworks or UI, I build small systems that emphasize:

* state modeling
* invariants
* atomic database transitions
* correctness under failure

Each project represents a specific concept I’ve implemented and debugged in depth.
The goal is to understand how backend systems behave under real conditions, not just how to make endpoints work.

You’ll find work here that focuses on:

* explicit service-layer design
* idempotent operations
* transactional persistence
* predictable state transitions

This portfolio is a record of learning through implementation.
